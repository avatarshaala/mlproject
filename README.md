# mlproject
This project includes implementation of following algorithms:
1. Perceptron
2. Multiple Layer Perceptron
3. Naive Bayes
4. K-Means
5. Random walk (Markov Chain)

These algorithms are implemented from scratch using pure python and NumPy. The script of each algorithm includes main function with test data that are hard coded to shows the steps to use the algorithms. However, those algorithms could be used for real datasets.
